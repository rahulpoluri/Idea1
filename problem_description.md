## Problem and Backstory  

As someone with liberal values, modest means, and a modern outlook, finding a compatible partner was an uphill battle. I sought a person who valued education, cultural inclusivity, and long-term commitment but faced challenges with the existing avenues:  

### 1. **Dating Apps** (e.g., Tinder, Bumble)  
Dating apps initially seemed appealing due to their inclusivity and diversity. However, they failed to deliver meaningful connections due to:  
- **Overwhelming Choices with Low Success Rates:** Despite hours of effort and premium subscriptions, meaningful matches were elusive. Research suggests over 90% of users fail to find lasting connections.  
- **Skewed Gender Ratios:** A significant male-to-female user imbalance created additional challenges for men.  
- **Fake and Unrealistic Profiles:** Inauthentic profiles led to frustration and wasted time.  
- **Addictive and Anxiety-Inducing Design:** Endless swiping felt more like a game than genuine relationship-building, leaving users disillusioned.  

After a year of trying, I found these platforms ineffective and unfulfilling.  

### 2. **Matrimonial Platforms** (e.g., Shaadi.com)  
Despite a preference for a love-based approach, I turned to matrimonial sites. Initially, I appreciated their structured matchmaking but encountered key issues:  
- **Parental Dominance:** Many profiles were managed by parents, who imposed restrictive criteria like caste and community over individual compatibility.  
- **Reinforced Biases:** Filters and preferences unintentionally promoted regressive norms.  
- **Limited User Autonomy:** Direct interactions between matches were often hindered by parental control.  

Through sheer luck, I met my wife on one of these platforms. Her liberal upbringing allowed us to connect directly and build a relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.  

This experience highlighted a glaring gap:  
- No platform genuinely supports individuals lacking family backing in their search for meaningful relationships.  
- Existing solutions fail to combine personalized guidance, inclusivity, and authenticity.  
- Cultural taboos about seeking help in love leave many struggling to navigate this process alone.
