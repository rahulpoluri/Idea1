**iris Dating**

Utilizes AI to verify user identities, ensuring authenticity and reducing catfishing. The platform focuses on connecting users based on compatibility, though it doesn’t specify structured online meetups. ￼


**Badoo**
Offers features like photo verification to ensure user authenticity and video chat options for real-time interaction. While it includes verification and online meetups, it lacks structured scheduling and AI-driven matchmaking. ￼While these platforms incorporate certain elements of your concept, none provide the full suite of features you’ve described, such as human verification via video calls, AI-powered matchmaking with a focus on short-term compatibility, structured and scheduled online interactions with pre-call guidelines, and post-call feedback mechanisms.

Some feature in tinder and ok cupid have video dates option but they are always after two people are intersted and they had a match and chat.
