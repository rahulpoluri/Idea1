  _Answer: 
  ### Dating APP's Problems:
  - They are made to engage in them as maximum as possible, as thier revenue is dependedent on how long people are single and want to find relationship.
  - Extreme gamification of the platforms with very unrealisitic expectations. People are presented with thousands of options to choose and even the good ones seem useless.
  - Extreme narrow approach on finding matches, with catchy Bio, catchy picture, and other weird techniquues to be used to succeed.
  - Men have extremely high failure rate in finding matches, only the top 10 percent are hightly successful and other are left out as women seek only them in thousands as there is too 
  much choice.
  - Women face different chanllenges where they often become picky in order to select the right one and they get bombarded with messages from hundreds of men at the same time making them
  stressed in answering all or picking the right one, and often times their best choice is best for everyone and are less chance eventually to make things go further.
  - People with average looks rerely succeed, as everything is about looks and cachy bio.
  - Men have a pressure to make the first move and they tend to write to hundreds of profiles a custom message going thought thie profiles which kills a lot time by spending countless 
  hours.
  - Often times its unclear on why the person is on the platoform, and do they similar interest in making a long-term meaningful relationship.
  - There is huge problem of fake profiles in dating apps, and that is by design because when they launch the app to market, people only join when they see so many options available, and
  in order to achieve that, comapnies often use bots or hired people to create a illusion of crowd there.
  - Data security is huge problem as companies might sell the data to third parties and which might lead to social engineering scams.
  - Harrassment of women on dating platforms is also a huge problem because to grab attention many people become cheesy and bahave inappropriately.
  - Ultimately they are not able to serve thier actual purpose of finding love or relationship for both men and women even after paying a lot.

  ### Matrimonial app problems:
  - They are extremely focussed on finding match based on hard filters of caste and community which is repelling for users with liberal thoughts and people who want to find love.
  - They are hijacked by parents and relatives instead of prospect bride and groom and talk is intiated by the relatives, which seem extemely traditional.
  - Manier times people get rejected by relatives just after checking thier hard filters.
  - As accounts are controlled by relatives and parents, the search gets extremely materialistic with things like salary, job, financial status, family members ignoring the actual 
  comptibility check.
  - Also as people are presented with thousands of profiles at once, people get extremely picky and target the best according to filters set, and average people get sidelined easily.
  - Particurly for me they have become tough place, to find a relation as bar set by people are too high.
  - Finding a love based relation is extremely difficult.
