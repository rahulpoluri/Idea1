# Key Questions to Answer Before Starting a Software Product Idea

When researching a software product idea, the goal is to thoroughly validate and refine the concept before diving into development. Below are the key areas to explore, along with specific questions to answer. Each question includes space for you to write down your findings or thoughts.

## 1. Understand the Problem and Market

- **What are the problems/pain points of your target users?**  
  ### Dating app's Problems:
  - They are made to engage in them as maximum as possible, as thier revenue is dependedent on how long people are single and want to find relationship.
  - Extreme gamification of the platforms with very unrealisitic expectations. People are presented with thousands of options to choose and even the good ones seem useless.
  - Extreme narrow approach on finding matches, with catchy Bio, catchy picture, and other weird techniquues to be used to succeed.
  - Men have extremely high failure rate in finding matches, only the top 10 percent are hightly successful and other are left out as women seek only them in thousands as there is too 
  much choice.
  - Women face different chanllenges where they often become picky in order to select the right one and they get bombarded with messages from hundreds of men at the same time making them
  stressed in answering all or picking the right one, and often times their best choice is best for everyone and they have less chance eventually to make things go further.
  - People with average looks rerely succeed, as everything is about looks and cachy bio.
  - Men have a pressure to make the first move and they tend to write to hundreds of profiles a custom message going though thier profiles which kills a lot time by spending countless 
  hours.
  - Often times its unclear on why the person is on the platform, and do they have similar interest in making a long-term meaningful relationship.
  - There is huge problem of fake profiles in dating apps, and that is by design because when they launch the app to market, people only join when they see so many options available, and
  in order to achieve that, comapnies often use bots or hired people to create a illusion of crowd there.
  - Data security is huge problem as companies might sell the data to third parties and which might lead to social engineering scams.
  - Harrassment of man and women on dating platforms is also a huge problem because to grab attention many people become cheesy and bahave inappropriately.
  - Manier times people feel fatigue and they dont use the app for days and other people wait for thier response for ages not knowing what happened and left ghosted.
  - Ultimately they are not able to serve thier actual purpose of finding love or relationship for both men and women even after paying a lot.

  ### Matrimonial app's problems:
  - They are extremely focussed on finding match based on hard filters of caste and community which is repelling for users with liberal thoughts and people who want to find love.
  - They are hijacked by parents and relatives instead of prospect bride and groom and talk is intiated by the relatives, which seem extemely traditional.
  - Manier times people get rejected by relatives just after checking thier hard filters.
  - As accounts are controlled by relatives and parents, the search gets extremely materialistic with things like salary, job, financial status, family members ignoring the actual 
  comptibility check.
  - Also as people are presented with thousands of profiles at once, people get extremely picky and target the best according to filters set, and average people get sidelined easily.
  - Particurly for men they have become tough place, to find a relation as bar set by people are too high.
  - People often communicate with multiple people simultaneously, reaching out to several at once. As these conversations unfold, comparisons between individuals often arise, creating a 
  state of dilemma where people may invest less effort in getting to know each person deeply.
  - Finding a love based relation is extremely difficult.
    
- **What problem does your product solve?**   
  Liberal Shaadi is platform designed to be hybrid of matrimonial sites and dating platform and of blind dating.
  - Users get a chance directly to speak to thier matches via video call.
  - Users will be guided to make thier bio and can express thier intent with the help of moderator and via userinterface.
  - Users don't have to spend a lot of time in finding a match or writing catchy messages to them as Algo does matching for them based on thier preferences and suitability and not just 
  looks or hard set filters.
  - Users pay per use of platform so they are not forced to stay on the platform forever.
  - Users can be assured to meet people with right intentions and right info as profiles are checked throughly by moderator and user info is validated via proofs.
  - Users can be assured that thier data is secure and they can be requested to deleted easily as app provides this access directly as they are made owners of thier data.
  - Users stay anonymous for certian period in this process, so they can be assured that they dont fall victim of harrassment.
  - Men and women theoritically will have equal success rate. (They might be different waiting times for them, but they dont waste time or money for waiting)
  - There will be no problem of decision paralysis as men and women can talk to only 1 person at a time.
  - As poeple are expected to speak by themselves and it is initiaed by them, there will be no problem of parental interference.
  - Users who doenst use accept call from matches for a spefic amount of time, will be taken out of the sysetem, thereby preventing ghosting.
  - Finally people who consider them average will be able to find success in this platform and they feel value for money.
  
- **Who is your target audience?**  
  Target audidence are roughly between 20 - 40 years old, with good professional background, who's intention is to find longterm relationship(As first target audience).
  Idea envisions to spread to India, EU, US and other parts of world slowly, but as first step focus is on metro cities in India.
  

- **How big is the market?**

  30 miliion targetable users in INDIA acroos various cities

---

## 7. Go-to-Market Strategy
- **How will you acquire users?**  
  As we dont have to show each user hundreds of profiles so one big problem is solved, to start as their is just 1-1 matching.
  but after starting we need person with given criteria to match, for which we need at atleast few profiles close to the user criteria to match, which can be tricky, for that we want to introduce wait times at start to user to make him be in list
  so that once we find enough matches for him we can start matching. Eventually when userbase increase this wait times
  reduce. And also as this system is based on appointment system, so we will definitely get some time. between each match to user.



- **What channels will you use for distribution?**  
  I would like to use 
  LinkedIn -as many professionals exist there
  Instagram -  as it is easy way to reach masses
  Bill boards might help to eshtablish the brand
  Working with social media influencers will be great help
  Also endorsing by media figure making a brand ambassador


- **How will you retain users?**  
  I dont want to retian users as that is not the goal of the platform, the goal of platform is to give paid service to user
  and gain his trust so that he can recommend others. Ideally if the user is successful he will not need the platform again.

  Customers who are picky will pay more to meet more people until they find the best one theyby they pay more.
  thereby only serious people who want genuine interest will choose the platform.

---

## 8. Risks and Challenges
- **What could go wrong?**  
  I think biggest risk is not able to provide user with thier match even after waiting time. and getting women onboard who is 
  willing to pay.

- **What are your contingency plans?**  
  To avoid the risk of long wait only thing we can do is, do continous advertising so that there are certian number of poeple
  availabe for each user, with cachy advertisements.
  Target only audience who can pay for the service.

---

## 9. Long-term Vision
- **What is the roadmap for growth?**  
  With more people onboard we could provide more quality matches to users. Users in India finally have platform where they
  can trust to meet new people and find thier life partners.

- **What partnerships or collaborations might be beneficial?**  
  collaboration with social media influencers, working closely with mental health specialist and marketing specialists will help.

- **What is the potential exit strategy?**  
  _Answer:_

---

## 10. Test Assumptions
- **What hypotheses are you making?**  
  People are really suffering from dating and matrimony apps
  Having too many options are creating unreachable expectations.
  People are willing to pay if we say you can directly meet new people cutting the clutter.

- **How will you test these assumptions?**  
  we want to run the survey to know peoples opinion these things
