Target Audience:
Young professionals in India and the European Union, particularly those who value meaningful, long-term relationships. These individuals often find it challenging to meet like-minded partners due to cultural, societal, or logistical barriers.

Problem and Backstory

When I reached a point in my life where I was relatively successful and ready to settle down, I struggled to find a compatible partner. As someone with liberal values, an average appearance, and no influential family backing, my journey was particularly challenging. I wanted to find a person who shared my outlook on life, was open to different cultures and communities, and valued education and a long-term commitment.

In my quest, I explored two common avenues:

1. Dating Apps (e.g., Tinder, Bumble)

These platforms seemed promising at first because they aligned with my liberal ideals of inclusivity and diversity. However, they fell short in several critical areas:
	•	Overwhelming Choices and Low Success Rate: Despite spending hours swiping and even investing in premium subscriptions, meaningful matches were rare. Statistics suggest that over 90% of users fail to find lasting connections on such platforms.
	•	Skewed Gender Ratio: A significant disparity between male and female users makes it even harder for men to find matches.
	•	Fake and Unrealistic Profiles: The prevalence of inauthentic profiles often leads to frustration.
	•	Addictive and Anxiety-Inducing: The endless swiping can feel more like a game than a genuine attempt at connection, leaving users feeling stagnant and disheartened.

After a year of trying, I found the experience ineffective and unfulfilling.

2. Matrimonial Sites (e.g., Shaadi.com)

Encouraged by friends, I reluctantly turned to matrimonial platforms, despite my preference for a love-based approach. Initially, I appreciated the structured nature of these platforms, where users could directly connect with potential matches. However, several challenges quickly became apparent:
	•	Parental Dominance: Many profiles are managed by parents who impose unrealistic expectations, often prioritizing caste and community over individual compatibility.
	•	Caste and Community Bias: These platforms unintentionally reinforce regressive societal norms by making caste and community key filtering criteria.
	•	Limited Autonomy: Users frequently struggle to engage directly with potential matches, as interactions are mediated through parents.

Despite these drawbacks, I was fortunate to meet my now-wife through such a platform. She had liberal parents who allowed her to take the initiative, and we built our relationship on mutual understanding and direct communication.

This experience illuminated a glaring gap:
	•	There is no platform that genuinely caters to individuals who lack family support but want to find meaningful, long-term relationships.
	•	Existing platforms fail to foster authentic human connections and often lack personalized guidance or support.
	•	Societal taboos around seeking help in finding love exacerbate the problem, leaving many to navigate this journey alone.

Solution

Liberal Shaadi aims to bridge this gap by creating a platform that prioritizes meaningful connections over superficial interactions.

Key features of the platform include:
	1.	Focused on Quality, Not Quantity:
	•	Users pay to engage in structured video conversations with potential matches, ensuring purposeful interactions rather than endless scrolling.
	2.	Human-Centered Approach:
	•	Dedicated human moderators guide users through the process, providing personalized advice and support.
	•	Backgrounds are thoroughly verified to foster trust and safety.
	3.	Inclusive and Barrier-Free:
	•	Open to all castes, communities, and backgrounds, prioritizing shared values and compatibility.
	4.	Secure Video Chatting:
	•	The platform facilitates secure, moderated video interactions, allowing users to get to know each other authentically before sharing personal details.
	5.	Empowering Users:
	•	Users take charge of their journey, with no interference from third parties like parents unless desired.

By combining technology with a human touch, Liberal Shaadi aims to create a space where individuals can genuinely connect, explore potential relationships, and build their future with confidence and autonomy.

This concept addresses a significant gap in the market and offers a fresh approach to finding love and companionship in a modern, inclusive, and thoughtful way.
