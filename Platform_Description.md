# Platform Description

## Platform Design and Functionality

- **User Profile Creation and Verification**:  
  Users should be able to provide detailed information, including:
  - Personal details (Name, Age, Address with Aadhaar).
  - Verification documents (Pictures, Salary slips, etc.).
  - Current work details and professional summary.
  - Family details.  
  All submitted details should undergo human verification via a phone call. During the call, moderators will:
  - Suggest improvements to the user's profile.
  - Document the userâ€™s motivations and aspirations in their profile.

- **Matching and Interaction**:  
  - The platform should use AI to find the most compatible matches, especially for short-term interactions (e.g., weekends).
  - A suitable meeting time should be scheduled for both parties with clear pre-instructions on behavior and expectations.
  - Calls between matches should be partially recorded for monitoring and feedback generation (potentially AI-driven).
  - After the initial call, both parties can either accept or reject the match.
  - If both parties agree, a second call is scheduled in the same manner. In case of rejection, constructive feedback should be provided.
  - After three successful calls, personal details of both individuals will be revealed, and they will exit the system.

## Quality of Life Enhancements

   - Employ culturally aware, empathetic individuals, ideally with international exposure and a modern mindset, who can build trust effectively.  

2. **Data Security**:
