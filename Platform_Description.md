# Platform Description

## How should the platform look like and function?

- In Platform users should be able to give their detials and verify themselves(Pictures, Name, Age, Address(with adhaar), Current Work details, professional summary(with salary slips), Family detials)
- Detials should be verified by Human again via call, should give suggestions on improving his detials and explain the process and know his motivations and his aspirations 
(should be documented in the profile).
- Should find a potential match (should be short time/ may be in weekends/ Here ai can be used to find best matches)
- Potential suitable time should be set for both parties and should be sent with pre-instructions and behaviour.
- Call should be partially recorded for monitoring purposes and (feedback should be generated in background may be with AI)
- After call both have a chance to think about and accept or reject each other.
- If they both want to continue a second call should be set in the same manner.(if there is rejection then the feedback should be provided)
- After three calls Personal detials of both have to be revealed to each other and they should be out of system.

## Roughly Plaform should have following features

1) Form to fill up and upload all the detials
2) Video chat feature to get on calls.
3) Mail or feedback feature to get to know updates
4) Mobile support to work easily on mobile/laptop/Tab
5) Payment feature to complete the payment
6) Scheduling feature to schedule on available slots for meets.
7) Appealing UI which gives confidence/clear instructions to users on each step
8) Data delete feature to have users control on their personal data.
9) Support portal to raise any queries.

## Other additional quality of life improvements:

1) The person who is moderating or talking to people is extremely important here, as he gives the impression about the plaform and its trustworthiness.
2) A cross culture facilitator / or a person who living abroad and young mindset who speak and listen good would be a great value add here.
3) Users should be made aware with the fact that thier data is very secure and they are the owners of it.
